# Android-Experiments-Epsilon
Hello there! This Repo contains a thousand and one tales about my Android "experiments", from the crones to the maidens, each with its own tale about my progress in the world of Android app development

Although I have been studying android development for almost 20 months(alongside other stuff), it was only recently I felt the need to keep an archive of some of my efforts somewhere other than on my local machine
